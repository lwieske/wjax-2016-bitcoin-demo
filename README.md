# Bitcoin Transaction Demo @ W-JAX 2016

The demo video (animated gif) was generated by calling

```
bash -x video-recoder.sh
```

in a iTerm2 terminal window sized 132x43 with 256 colors.

The recorder script in turn calls asciinema with a session/call to run_txs.sh.

Some post processing at the end of the recorder script shrinks the gif.
